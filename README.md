# PACMAN - The Original
###### Web Design's Course Project for _@University of Pisa_
The project's aim is to create a working website to provide a real world application service.
My project is a simple replica of the original Pacman game by NAMCOÂ®

---

#### USAGE
<strong>Pacman</strong> is an arcade game that involves moving the protagonist within a map, eating as many food items as possible while avoiding contact with ghosts, which are also present on the map. <br>
In addition to the game itself, the project offers the ability to collect <em>coins</em> that can be spent in the <strong>store</strong> to customize game elements. <br>
There is also a page dedicated to player <strong>statistics</strong> and the overall <em>ranking</em>.
Create your <strong>own account</strong> after the signup and try the game: the collected credits will be sufficient to purchase at least one skin for each type (<em>pacman</em>, <em>ghost</em> and <em>map</em>)

#### INSTALLATION

1. Use XAMPP and host the website on your machine (localhost).
2. Launch the pacman.sql file into your DB manager to setup the database. 
3. Open your browser to access the website.

<!-- Here's a tutorial on how to do it. -->
